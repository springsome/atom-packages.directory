<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Atom editor only allows for a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36929817/is-there-a-way-to-apply-multiple-themes-to-an-atom-editor-session-e-g-per-pane/37606434#37606434">single <em>monolithic</em> theme</a>
  to be applied across all your tabs, panes, and windows.  This is a disappointing, and somewhat surprising fact of life in the Atom ecosystem given its excellent overall customization capabilities.  Other editors such as <em>emacs</em>, have long allowed multiple themes to be applied at various levels of granularity (e.g. by window, by file, or file type).</p>

<p>Well no more.</p>

<p><em>Multi-theme-applicator</em>, in the spirit of the emacs package
<a href="https://github.com/vic/color-theme-buffer-local">color-theme-buffer-local</a> , allows you to apply any installed syntax theme, at file level granularity, to any of the editors in your editing session. With <em>multi-theme-applicator</em>, you now have this powerful capability available in Atom, making the best browser in its class that much better.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>Experienced developers know that they can easily have dozens of separate files open over a long-lived editing session, with anywhere from 12 to 20 of those files being on the “active” workflow at any one time.  Thus being able to visually categorize your work files is essential:  decreasing the likelihood of “losing your place”, and avoiding costly mistakes like editing the wrong file.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>multi-theme-applicator</em>, is a tool for increasing your workflow efficiency.</p>

<p>Allowing multiple coloring themes allows you to group files, and serves as a visual reminder for what “document-plex” you are currently in (for those who distribute their workload over multiple workspaces).</p>

<p>Additionally, since you don’t have to commit to one all-encompassing theme, it allows you to experiment with many more of the outstanding themes available for Atom.  So now it becomes no big deal to try out an “exotic” theme such as, say,  <a href="https://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/">fairyfloss</a>, since you can restrict it to as small an “area” as a single file.</p>

<p>Allowing editor level theming is also useful when your global themes looks good on one file type, but not so good on others.  Having this problem?  Simply pick another theme that looks good on the other file type and your problem is solved.  No more trying to find that one perfect theme that works across all your file types.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Tested on Atom 1.8.0, and 1.10.0 on Mac, Windows 10, and Linux Mint 17.3.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Install from the Atom control panel as you would for any standard Atom package.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>#### Overview
When you activate the <em>multi-theme-applicator</em> (MTA) panel with <em>shift-ctrl-v</em> (windows/linux) or <em>shift-cmd-v</em> (mac), you are presented with a list of the currently available themes.  The panel and theme selection can be entirely controlled with home-row friendly key bindings or via mouse.  Select the theme you want and click <em>Apply Local Theme</em> or press <em>Enter</em>. You will then see all the editors associated with the file of the active editor assume that theme.  Having selected a new theme, the dialog will still remain active, allowing you to quickly iterate through and apply several themes until you find just the right one.  When you’re done, toggle the <em>multi-theme-applicator</em> to close by pressing the <em>escape</em> key, <em>ctrl-shift-v</em>, or clicking the “x” button, and resume working.</p>

<h4 id="typical-workflow">Typical Workflow</h4>
<p>1) We start in a session with three open files across three panes in the default monolithic theme <em>atom-dark</em>.</p>

<p>Note how two of the panes are open on one file and the third pane on another file and how relatively difficult it is to visually distinguish between them:<br />
<br /><br />
<img src="https://github.com/vt5491/multi-theme-applicator/blob/master/assets/img/mta_workflow_start.png?raw=true" alt="fig 1" /></p>

<p>2) We want to apply the <em>humane</em> theme to file ‘utils.coffee’ that is visually active in the left pane (pane 1), and upper right pane (pane 2), and in a non-selected tab in the lower right pane (pane 3).</p>

<p>While either pane 1 or pane 2 is active, type <em>shift-ctrl-v</em> or <em>shift-cmd-v</em> (or activate the command palette and type ‘multi’) and activate the MTA modal panel.  The modal dialog should come up with keyboard focus:
  <br />
  <img src="https://github.com/vt5491/multi-theme-applicator/blob/master/assets/img/mta_workflow_dialog.png?raw=true" alt="2" />
    Note how the syntax theme selected item is a darker color and has a slightly larger border to denote its been selected.</p>

<p>3) At this point, press ‘ctrl-n’ and ‘ctrl-p’ or the arrow keys to scroll through the list.  Alternatively, you can press ‘shift-alt-v’ to “expand” the full list of themes (Unfortunately, if you expand the themes, ctrl-n and ctrl-p won’t work for scrolling and you have to use the arrow keys).<br />
  * If you know the theme you want to apply, you can quickly narrow down on it by typing the first letter of the theme.  For instance, if I type “d” on my system, the dropdown jumps to “dracula” in the list, allowing me to select it right away. If this is not the “d” theme you had in mind, then you can press <em>ctrl-n</em> and <em>ctrl-p</em> to scroll through its neighbors, or keep pressing the letter to get the next theme that starts with that letter.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>Here we type ‘h’ to quickly locate the <em>humane</em> theme:
<img src="https://github.com/vt5491/multi-theme-applicator/blob/master/assets/img/mta_workflow_humane_pre_apply.png?raw=true" alt="3" /><br />
<br /><br />
4) Hit Enter key, or press the <em>Apply Local Theme</em> button to activate the new theme.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/vt5491/multi-theme-applicator/blob/master/assets/img/mta_workflow_humane_post_apply.png?raw=true" alt="4" />
<br /></p>

<p>Note 1: The theme was applied at the file level, not the editor level (new feature added in v 0.8.0).  All three editors that are opened on file ‘utils.cofee’ will have the new theme, saving you the hassle of having to apply it three times.  Of course, only two editors with the selected file are visible in this current example since the editor in pane 3 is in a tab that is not currently visible.  However, if we do activate the file’s tab in that pane, it will also have the new theme.</p>

<p>Note 2: Even after the theme is applied the dialog is still active, so you can scroll to another theme, hit Enter again, and apply that theme.  This allows you to quickly decide if you like the theme or not, without having to go through the whole selection process again.</p>

<p>Note 3: Observe how much easier it is to distinguish between the files with multi-themes.</p>

<p>5) If you like your new theme, toggle the modal dialog off by by pressing <em>ctrl-shift-v</em> or <em>escape</em> (or invoke ctrl-shift-p and search for “multi”), or clicking the “x” button. If we swtich to pane 3 and activate the hidden tab, you’ll see that it too has the new theme.  Congratulations, you now have a mixed theme session!  Repeat as desired to your other files.</p>

<p>Note: with version 0.9.0, MTA remembers the theme applied to each file. See release notes below for more details.</p>

<br /></p>

<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ol>
  <li>If you don’t like all the different themes and want to return to the default, just press ‘ctrl-alt-r’ which will refresh Atom (while keeping your pane and file hierarchy) and restore the default theme to every panel i.e. no need to hard cycle (close and re-open) the editor itself.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="keybindings">Keybindings</h4>
<p>The following default key bindings are in effect:</p>

<p>shift-ctrl-v : Toggle MTA (mult-theme-applicator) (window/linux)
shift-cmd-v : Toggle MTA (mult-theme-applicator) (Mac)
shift-alt-v: Give MTA dialog keyboard focus (in editor context)<br />
ctrl-n: scroll down through themes<br />
ctrl-p: scroll up through themes<br />
shift-alt-v: expand the theme list (in modal dialog context)<br />
escape: close the MTA dialog (when it has keyboard focus)</p>

<p>You can also close the MTA dialog by clicking the “x” button.</p>

<p>Note 1: ‘shift-alt-v’ is used twice: once in the editor context, and the other in the modal dialog context.</p>

<p>Note 2: Quite frankly, some of these are kind of tricky key bindings.  I have emacs and vim key bindings in effect on Atom, and finding free key bindings is difficult.  If you don’t have this problem, you can probably make better choices.  See note 3 about how to do this.</p>

<p>Note 3: to change the keybindings, edit $HOME/.atom/packages/mult-theme-applicator/multi-theme-applicator.cson, or use the keybindings section of the Settings panel.</p>

<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>
<p>1) The package does not yet currently allow for any higher-level grouping such as by file type, or by window.</p>

<p>Future enhancements such as specifying a theme at the file level, or by file type (say all ‘.js’ files are light themed, all ‘java’ are dark-themed etc), or physical theming at the window level are certainly possible.</p>

<h3 id="release-history">Release History</h3>
<p>2016-09-03 - version 0.9.0<br />
This release introduces quite a large amount of new functionality.  Basically, local theming has been made much more “sticky”, and requires less manual intervention and re-application.  In short, it’s starting to work a lot more like one “would expect”, and fixes several edge cases where themes were previously not applied as expected.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The package now listens on pane events, such as splitting the screen, and will automatically apply the appropriate theme for that file.  In other words, you should only have to apply the file theme once, and that theme should show on all editors for that file, across all life-cycle events including adding new editors.</li>
  <li>file level theming is now persisted across atom cyclings i.e. if you close atom completely, and then start it again, once you invoke mta (shift-ctrl-v) then the local themes you supplied for any open files will be re-themed automatically.</li>
  <li>Added a new command ‘mta-reset’ to reset the “theme memory”, but you should normally not want to use this.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug on mac where the “apply local theme” button was not driving the appropriate event handler.</li>
</ol>

<p>2016-06-30 - version 0.8.0<br />
1. Added file level theming.<br />
2. Added Mac-friendly key binding <em>shift-cmd-v</em><br />
3. Added a little better styling to the modal dialog.<br />
4. Updated README to reflect new changes.</p>

<p>2016-06-09 - version 0.7.0<br />
1. Improved key binding support<br />
  * Modal dialog now comes up with focus – no need to press <em>alt-shift-v</em> first.
  * <em>ESC</em> key now closes the dialog.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Added close button on modal dialog</li>
</ol>

<p>2016-05-29 - version 0.6.1
- Initial release.</p>
